                Body mass index (BMI) is a value derived 
                from the mass (weight) and height of a person. 
                The BMI is defined as the body mass divided by 
                the square of the body height, and is expressed 
                in units of kg/m<sup>2</sup>, resulting from mass in 
                kilograms and height in metres.
            </p>
            <p>
                The BMI may be determined using a table or chart 
                which displays BMI as a function of 
                mass and height using contour lines or colours for 
                different BMI categories, and which may use other 
                units of measurement (converted to metric units for 
                the calculation)

                Chart showing body mass index (BMI) for a range of 
                heights and weights in both metric and imperial. 
                Colours indicate BMI categories defined by the 
                World Health Organization; underweight, normal weight, 
                overweight, moderately obese, severely obese and very 
                severely obese.
            </p>
            <p style="margin-top: 5%;">
                The BMI is a convenient rule of thumb used to broadly 
                categorize a person as underweight, normal weight, overweight, 
                or obese based on tissue mass (muscle, fat, and bone) and 
                height. Major adult BMI classifications are underweight (under 
                18.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), normal weight (18.5 to 24.9), overweight (25 to 
                29.9), and obese (30 or more). When used to predict an 
                individual's health, rather than as a statistical measurement 
                for groups, the BMI has limitations that can make it less 
                useful than some of the alternatives, especially when applied 
                to individuals with abdominal obesity, short stature, or 
                unusually high muscle mass.
            </p>
            <p>
                BMIs under 20 and over 25 have been associated with higher 
                all-cause mortality, with the risk increasing with distance 
                from the 20-25 range.

                Adolphe Quetelet, a Belgian astronomer, mathematician, 
                statistician, and sociologist, devised the basis of the BMI 
                between 1830 and 1850 as he developed what he called 
                &quot;social physics&quot;. Quetelet himself never intended 
                for the index, then called the Quetelet Index, to be used as 
                a means of medical assessment. Instead, it was a component of 
                his study of l&lsquo;homme moyen, or the average man. Quetelet 
                thought of the average man as a social ideal, and developed 
                the body mass index as a means of discovering the socially 
                ideal human person. According to Lars Grue and 
                Arvid Heiberg in the Scandinavian Journal of Disability 
                Research, Quetelet's idealization of the average man would be 
                elaborated upon by Francis Galton a decade later in the 
                development of Eugenics.
            </p>
            <p>
                The modern term &quot;body mass index&quot; (BMI) for the ratio 
                of human body weight to squared height was coined in a paper 
                published in the July 1972 edition of the Journal of Chronic 
                Diseases by Ancel Keys and others. In this paper, Keys argued 
                that what he termed the BMI was &quot;if not fully satisfactory, 
                at least as good as any other relative weight index as an indicator 
                of relative obesity&quot;.
            </p>
            <p>
                The interest in an index that measures body fat came with 
                observed increasing obesity in prosperous Western societies. 
                Keys explicitly judged BMI as appropriate for population 
                studies and inappropriate for individual evaluation. 
                Nevertheless, due to its simplicity, it has come to be widely 
                used for preliminary diagnoses. Additional metrics, such as 
                waist circumference, can be more useful.
            </p>
            <p>
                BMI provides a simple numeric measure of a person's thickness or 
                thinness, allowing health professionals to discuss weight problems 
                more objectively with their patients. BMI was designed to be used 
                as a simple means of classifying average sedentary 
                (physically inactive) populations, with an average body composition. 
                For such individuals, the BMI value recommendations as of 2014 
                are as follows: 18.5 to 24.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup> may indicate optimal weight, 
                lower than 18.5 may indicate underweight, 25 to 29.9 may indicate 
                overweight, and 30 or more may indicate obese. Lean male athletes 
                often have a high muscle-to-fat ratio and therefore a BMI that 
                is misleadingly high relative to their body-fat percentage
